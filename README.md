# System Design Research

This repository is a curated collection of projects and resources assembled for **personal research and reference** in system design.

The goal is not to build a single unified system, but to explore and learn from **real-world architectures, implementations, and tools**. Each submodule represents a standalone project or guide that provides valuable insights into various aspects of designing scalable, maintainable, and performant systems.

## 🔍 Purpose

- Serve as a **research hub** for system design patterns and practices
- Aggregate **instructive open-source repositories**
- Track best practices in backend engineering, architecture, and distributed systems
- Enable experimentation and hands-on learning
